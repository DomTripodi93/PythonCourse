Hello!

In the next lecture we will be talking about multiple inheritance with more than 1 parent class.


Your assignment is in 5 parts:
1. Convert the "Furniture" constructor to use **kwargs
2. Add a new for_office attribute to the "Furniture" class and it's constructor
3. Create a new "OfficeFurniture" class that inherits from "Furniture" and sets for_office to True by default
4. Create a new "OfficeChair" class that inherits from "Chair" and "OfficeFurniture"
5. Make sure that "OfficeChair" only requires price, and uses the constructors from "Chair" and "OfficeFurniture" to set the can_sit and for_office attributes


See you in the next lecture!
