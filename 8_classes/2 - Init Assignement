Hello!

In the next lecture we will be talking about the __init__ method and setting a couple of values for our class from the __init__ method.

Your assignment is to implement an __init__ method on your "Furniture" class that will set the price attribute and create two instances of the class with different prices.


See you in the next lecture!
Dominic
