Hello!

In the next lecture we will be talking about what a class is and creating out first class as an abstract idea.

Your assignment is to implement a "Furniture" class that has a price attribute and use what we learn to create an instance of the "Furniture" class with a different price than the default.


See you in the next lecture!
Dominic
