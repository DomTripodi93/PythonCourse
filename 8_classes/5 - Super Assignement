Hello!

In the next lecture we will be talking about super and accessing logic from a parent class that is overridden.


Your assignment is in 4 parts:
1. Add a can_sit attribute to the "Furniture" class
2. Set can_sit from the "Furniture" constructor, but not the "Chair" constructor
3. Call the "Furniture" class's __init__ method from the "Chair" class, passing True for can_sit.
4. (bonus) Create a new price comparison method with updated output text

See you in the next lecture!
