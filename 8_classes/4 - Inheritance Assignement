Hello!

In the next lecture we will be talking about inheritance and accessing logic from a parent class.


Your assignment is in 4 parts:
1. Implement a "Chair" class that will inherit from "Furniture".
2. Use the price comparison method inherited from "Furniture", from an instance of the "Chair" class. 
3. Override the price comparison method to take no arguments, and always compare the instance price to 1000.
4. Call your overridden price comparison to make sure it works as expected.



See you in the next lecture!
