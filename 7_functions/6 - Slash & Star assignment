Hello!

In the next lecture we will be talking about the "/" and "*" arguments in a function.

Your assignment is in 3 parts:
1. Update the capitalize_words function to take a show_result positional only argument.
2. Print the result to the console when capitalize_words is True.
3. Convert the string_to_check argument to a keyword only argument.


See you in the next lecture!
