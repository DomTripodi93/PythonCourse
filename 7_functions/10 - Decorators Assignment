Hello!

In the next lectures we will be talking about the decorators.

Your assignment is in 4 parts:
1. Update your capitalize_words_create function to take in and call a callback fuction.
2. pass result_string to the callback function.
3. Create a function, show_result, that takes in a single argument and prints the argument after the string "Here is the result: ".
4. Decorate your new show_result function with capitalize_words_create.


See you in the next lecture!
